        <h2> <b> Friends Forever </b> </h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Dear Girl,<br>
            <br>
            In good times and in bad times, I am happy that you are always near to my heart. I want to let you know that you are one of my most important person in the world. It’s you I talk and open my heart to. It’s with you I exchange sorrows, expectations, and hopes for a better life and future. It’s you that I feel totally at ease to ask for advise. In a nutshell, I believe there’s no bigger love if it cannot be expressed by a friendship based on trust and openness, which allows us to show our weaknesses and wounds. Therefore, and because I can’t find the words to tell you this face to face, I decided to send you this letter. It’s important to me to confess this immense trust I have in you and to tell you how pleased and how safe this trust makes me feel. I think this is love, a friendly love (or even bigger) that, unfortunately, can not be explicit and shown at all times, without risking to become victim of the most old-fashioned ignorance and prejudice there is, that doesn’t accept spiritual love, without malice or desire.

        <h2> <b> To My Best Friend </b> </h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Dear Boy, <br>
            <br>
            I remembered during first day of eleventh grade, you were sitting next to me in the orientation. We barely know each other but I was glad you approached me. We became classmates and even seatmates for two years. We hanged out each time possible: recess, lunch breaks, groupworks, and after class hours with our other friends. We shared each other's secrets and became best of friends. It was such a coincidence how we also ended up in the same college.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am sending this letter to you, for two reasons. First, I want to let you know that I had a huge crush on you during twelvth grade. Second, I want to thank you also for all of the memories that we had. I hope our friendship won't change. I am just saddened by the fact that you suddenly moved away. I miss you more every single day.
            <br>
            <br>
            Love, <br>
            Your friend
